# Diagnostic Analytics System for Supply Chain Disruptions

## Project Overview
In this project, we developed an AI-driven diagnostic analytics system designed to help FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) companies mitigate supply chain disruptions. By leveraging historical data and real-time inputs, the system dynamically identifies recurring patterns, performs root cause analysis, and recommends proactive countermeasures. The system aims to help supply chain managers take action before disruptions occur.

## Problem Statement
FMCG companies frequently face supply chain disruptions due to various factors such as unforeseen demand fluctuations, supplier delays, logistics bottlenecks, and regional economic factors. Traditional methods focus on post-incident reporting, but our solution provides a real-time approach to identifying root causes and taking preventive action.

## Objectives
* Analyze historical disruptions to detect recurring patterns in supply chain failures.

* Develop an anomaly detection model that flags potential supply chain risks.

* Implement causal inference techniques to determine the true drivers of disruptions (weather impact, supplier performance, transport failures).

* Create a real-time interactive dashboard to alert managers about emerging risks and suggest countermeasures.

* Provide a self-learning system that refines its predictions based on new incoming data.

## Features
  1. Historical Disruption Analysis:

     Identifies and visualizes recurring patterns in supply chain disruptions.
  
     Heatmap for disruption frequency, categorized by region and type of disruption.

  2. Real-Time Risk Detection:

      A multi-variable anomaly detection model flags potential risks before they materialize.
      
      Alerts supply chain managers when specific metrics (e.g., delivery delays, weather events) deviate from normal behavior.

  3. Root Cause Analysis:
      
      Causal inference techniques determine the root causes of disruptions, whether they stem from weather conditions, supplier issues, or logistics bottlenecks.
      
      Provides detailed insights on the drivers of each disruption event.

  4. Interactive Dashboard:

      Real-time visualization of key metrics (e.g., delivery times, supplier delays, inventory levels).
      
      Interactive charts and filters for drilling down into specific disruptions or regions.
      
      Recommendations for countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies.
      
  5. Self-Learning System:
      
      Continuously learns from newly incoming data to improve the accuracy of predictions and risk identification.
      
      Adapts to changing patterns in disruptions and adjusts predictions dynamically.

## System Architecture

  1. Data Collection:

      Aggregates historical supply chain data from multiple sources: sales data, inventory data, supplier performance, production data, logistics data, and external factors (weather, economic, etc.).

  2. Anomaly Detection:

      Uses statistical and machine learning techniques (e.g., isolation forests, time series anomaly detection) to identify deviations from expected patterns.

  3. Causal Inference:

      Implements causal inference techniques (e.g., Granger Causality, Bayesian Networks) to uncover the true drivers behind supply chain disruptions.

  4. Dashboard Frontend:

      Built with [React/Tailwind] to provide an interactive interface for real-time monitoring and alerts.

      Key visualizations include heatmaps, line graphs, pie charts, and detailed risk reports.

  5. Backend:

      [Flask/Django] API for handling data inputs, anomaly detection, and causal inference processing.
      
      Real-time data pipeline integration for seamless updates.
